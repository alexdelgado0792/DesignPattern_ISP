# Interface Segregation Principle

"No client should be forced to depend on methods that it does not use. ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones".

Robert C. Martin definition:
"Make fine-grained interfaces that are client specific".

Differences between LSP and ISP:
The LSP is about subtyping and inhrtitance. The ISP is about business logic to client comunication.
